# Personal Recipe Database

There are a lot of recipes on the internet. Unfortunately, most of them are bad. I currently store a bunch of recipes in catgorized folders. Probem is that many dishes fit multiple categories. For example: falafel can both be snack food and a meal. The plan here is to have a project that stores pdfs and uses mongo to tag the metadata. then I can use a get request to perform queries and find recipes that fit a specific tag.
